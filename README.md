### Project Description
Our project is a budgeting and savings app designed to help individuals easily manage their finances by tracking daily expenses and setting savings goals. It provides real-time insights into spending patterns and offers visualizations to promote financial awareness, helping users stay on track and reduce financial stress.

### The Problem statement
Many individuals struggle with managing their finances, leading to stress, anxiety, and even mental health crises. Poor budgeting, unchecked spending, and lack of savings often result in overwhelming debt and financial insecurity.
